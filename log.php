        <h2>JIT - Just in Time! <img src="images/symbol.jpg" alt="symbol"> </h2>
        <p>Sonfast has always thrived on the business model of JUST IN TIME delivery. If a VMI is not the route a customer chooses to go, Sonfast offers JIT supply by stocking items on a long term forecast or blanket purchase order. This makes it easier for both our customers and us, to respond to inventory fluctiation in a very short amount of time. Sonfast is proactive in planning and purchasing for its JIT partnerships and we don't want you to have to worry about anything. When you've got Sonfast, you're problems are solved before they show up!</p>
