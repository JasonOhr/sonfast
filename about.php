            <p>With locations in South Carolina and Pennsylvania, and close to 18,000 square feet of warehouse space, we are strategically located to meet your distribution needs in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast United States.</p>
            <p>Sonfast Corporation, started by Richard and Debby Pappy in 1979, was originally a fastener house, specializing in the strict distribution of bulk fasteners to OEMs. Over time, Sonfast has evolved into a supplier of anything you can hold in two hands. While we still supply bulk fasteners, we believe that the evolution of wholesale distribution has taken a turn toward versatility of product lines and advanced application solutions offering more than just a nut and a bolt.</p>
            <p>Sonfast operates as a Christian Business under Christian principles and values. We believe in treating our customers how we would like to be treated.</p>
            <p>Our goal as an ISO Registered company is to deliver first class quality and service at world class prices. We offer a full range of quality testing capabilities in our South Carolina facility. We offer micro hardness, surface hardness, salt spray testing. We certify all of our parts to whatever specifications you may require, DFARS, REACH, RoHS Compliance, etc.</p>
            <p>We have a wonderful group of people who are eager to serve. Sonfast employees are full participants in a carefully integrated system of product sourcing, inventory management, quality control, and customer satisfaction. Give Sonfast the opportunity to show you that the small business approach is what your company needs!</p>
